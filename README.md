# JITScript
An intentional and optionally secure ECMAScript high-bred with intelligent design..

Just when you thought ECMAScript / javascript was finally overcoming all it's weaknesses... we now introduce to you for your pleasure and general well-being: JITScript.  

## What is JITScript?

It's a thing, or we are hopefull it will be.  It offers:
* support for all major browsers and some populat platforms as well
* both plugin and native browser support
* secure byte-encoded packages for faster and less-hackable code delivery.
* platform compilation for building applications
* seperation of variable and prototype values, using '#'.  fe. MyClass#constructor or #constructor from within he definition.
* POSIX type String & Regex support
* Both tight and loose type variables and constants.
* Argument typing.
* Operator definitions.
* Class and Interface candy and support.
* Migration (both to and from) Javascript, C, C++, Java, Lua and Python.

## When is it available?

Well it is available now, but it is still in pre-alpha state and mostly embriotic.

## How can I use it?

Clone or download this repo.  NPMjs is not far behind.  However currently there is only conceptual plugin code written in C++11 and compile-to-ECMA6cript tools available.  

## How can I support it?

Good question!

For starters start using it.  Second petition browser vendors to natively use and support JITScript, those are the biggest needs at the moment.

If you are an experienced coder, or just wish to create some demos, please feel free to contribute demos, bug fixes or potentinal solutions for this project.

And of course we can definitley use funding, we do accept paypal.
